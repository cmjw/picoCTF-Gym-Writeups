# Heap 0

This challenge gives us a binary, chall, and C program, chall.c. We are also given a connection to an instance of the challenge.

Running the program, we see the goal is to overflow the heap, and corrupt the variable safe_var. The program gives the user the option to specify an input value to allocate on the heap at a predefined location.

One of the functions of the program is to print the current address and value of these two variables: safe_var and the user-specified variable. For example, in one instance, the user variable is located at 0x557bbc31f6b0, and safe_var is located at 0x557bbc31f6d0. This is a difference of 0x20, or 0d32. 

Examining the C source code, we see that both the user input and safe_var are allocated 5 bytes each. This heap memory is allocated using malloc(). Thus, the two 5 byte allocated memory chunks are not guaranteed to be contiguous.

Going back to the addresses the two variables are located at, there is a difference of 0d32 between the two variable locations. Thus, by writing at least 32 characters into the location of the user input, we overwrite the memory allocated for safe_var.
